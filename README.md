## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This was a good project and I learnt alot from it, like from the html to css; there's a whole of new tricks on how to get the work done.

### Continued development

I want to really learn more on responsiveness, working through it really gives me a tough time.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://www.appbrewery.com) - This helped me for my programming journey so far. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
- [Example resource 2](https://www.developer.mozilla.org) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand some coding terminology. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
